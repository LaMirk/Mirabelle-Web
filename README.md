# Portfolio Site

This repository contains the source code for my personal **portfolio and interactive lab**.  
The site showcases my work as a **software engineer engaged in research and development of artificial intelligence** and its applications across diverse domains.  

## Features
- **Completed Projects** – implementations, prototypes, and experiments in AI and software engineering.  
- **Blog** – articles on technology, research, and broader topics like music, cooking, hobbies, and other areas where AI can provide unique insights.  
- **Interactive Experiences** – video games, experimental interfaces, and creative tools built to demonstrate and explore AI in action.  
- **Challenges & Experiments** – open-ended projects designed to push boundaries and spark imagination.  

## Purpose
This portfolio is not only a showcase of past work but also a **sandbox for exploration**—  
a place where technical research meets creativity, and where ideas can evolve into interactive, shareable experiences.
